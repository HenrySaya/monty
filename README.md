0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Stacks implement the LIFO principle meaning the last element to be insterted into the data structure will be the first element to be remove or ot.
Queues on the other hand use the FIFO principle since the first element in the data structure will be the first element out.This is since the queue data structure is open on both ends, the front end being responsible for the dequeue operation and the rear end being for the enqueue operation.
FIFO is also the LILO princple 
LIFO is same as saying FILO
